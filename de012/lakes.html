                Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me? <br>
                I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones <br>
                These hunters with cell phones <br>

                Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die <br>
                I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you <br>
                Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry <br>
                I'm setting off, but not without my muse <br>

                What should be over burrowed under my skin <br>
                In heart-stopping waves of hurt <br>
                I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze <br>
                Tell me what are my words worth <br>
                Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die <br>
                I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you <br>
                Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry <br>
                I'm setting off, but not without my muse <br>

                I want auroras and sad prose <br>
                I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet <br>
                'Cause I haven't moved in years <br>
                And I want you right here <br>
                A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground <br>
                With no one around to tweet it <br>
                While I bathe in cliffside pools <br>
                With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief <br>
